### Hi there 👋

I specialize in the development of business projects from scratch as single FullStack Developer and Team Developer, no metter - FrontEnd or Backend. Can use frameworks and librarys for fast resolving and completely self-written solutions without libraries. I also create plugins and themes for WordPress and automate any business processes.
